Video Game Sales and Success Prediction Analysis
📌 Project Description

This project explores global video game sales and user behavior for the online store Ice, which distributes games worldwide. Using open-source data containing reviews, genres, platforms, ESRB ratings, and historical sales, the goal was to identify the key factors that determine whether a game becomes a hit or not.

By analyzing data from 2016, the study simulates a real-world business scenario — planning marketing strategies and predicting successful game releases for 2017. The insights derived help guide decisions on product promotion, investment in specific platforms, and audience targeting.

🎯 Objective

To uncover the patterns and variables that influence video game success — such as platform popularity, user and critic reviews, genre, and regional preferences — and use them to inform data-driven marketing and sales strategies.

🧠 Tools and Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)

Jupyter Notebook

Statistical Hypothesis Testing

Correlation and Regression Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📊 Key Results & Insights

Identified platform life cycles, showing how top-performing platforms (e.g., PS4, Xbox One) gradually replaced older ones.

Found a moderate positive correlation between critic scores and game sales, while user scores had a weaker impact.

Highlighted that Action, Sports, and Shooter genres dominate global sales, though preferences differ across regions (e.g., Japan favors Role-Playing games).

Discovered regional market variations: North America prefers high-rated action games, while Europe shows stronger engagement with sports titles.

Confirmed through hypothesis testing that user ratings vary significantly between genres, but not between PC and Xbox platforms.

💡 Learnings

Apply statistical analysis to real-world business problems.

Use EDA and data visualization to uncover commercial insights.

Communicate findings clearly to non-technical audiences.
